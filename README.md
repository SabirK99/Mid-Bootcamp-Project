# Mid-Bootcamp-Project
Ironhack data analytics class, Mid-Bootcamp-Project (survey based).
This project is about reading vs listening to books and whether people tend to switch more often to audiobooks now that there are a lot of different platforms of audiobooks available.
For this project, primary data has been gathered through survey on reading vs listening preferences based on demographics such as gender and age groups.
After analysing the data through data cleaning and hypothesis testings a product idea based on audiobook website has been developed.
